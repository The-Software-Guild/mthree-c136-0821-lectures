// Part 1: User Authentication and Application Security
// Create a multi-page application using MERN. You will create a Shopping Cart Dashboard using JWT's  
// The Dashboard should contain a list of products.
// The Users using this dashboard are divided in 2 categories:
//             - Admin
//             - Normal

// Normal Users register themself via the register page, and Admin Users should be added manually in the database.
// The Admin should have the access to the following pages: Shopping list, Add Product, User List, Add User. 
// (For reference use the diagrams in the assets folder)
        
// Normal users can see only the shopping list page.
// The admin user has the access to add a new admin user as well as normal use.

// Project Requirements: 
// 1) Must secure all passwords via a hashing algorithm
// 2) Must use JWT's
// 3) Must use React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, & MongoDB
// 4) Must have multiple page including a landing page set up via React Router
// 5) Must make use of a 'protected route' paradaim
// 6) Make use of the React Context API to avoid prop drilling and share authentication logic
// 7) Must be fully styled and responsive

// If finished, please take a look at the GraphQL content in engage and get ready to begin that tomorrow
// by either refactoring this to GQL or setting up a simple serve and connecting to
// Apollo's sandbox. Get comfortable with GQL's query syntax and terminology (mutations)
