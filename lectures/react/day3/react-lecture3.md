#### Hooks

[Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM). They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

**No Breaking Changes**

Before we continue, note that Hooks are:

- **Completely opt-in.** You can try Hooks in a few components without rewriting any existing code. But you don’t have to learn or use Hooks right now if you don’t want to.

- **100% backwards-compatible.** Hooks don’t contain any breaking changes.

- **Available now.** Hooks are now available with the release of v16.8.0.

- **There are no plans to remove classes from React.** You can read more about the gradual adoption strategy for Hooks in the bottom section of this page.

**Hooks don’t replace your knowledge of React concepts.** Instead, Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle — hooks also offer a new powerful way to combine them.
