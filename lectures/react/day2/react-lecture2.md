### 1. react-day1-review

- Introduction to React.js
- Event Handling
- Routing
- Unit Tests With Jest & Enzyme

#### 3. Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

- You cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly

- You generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

- When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class.

#### **This**

You have to be careful about the meaning of _this_ in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called.

This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, **if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.**

If calling bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental public class fields syntax, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks.

```Javascript
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick.
  // Warning: this is *experimental* syntax.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

^This syntax is enabled by default in Create React App.

If you aren’t using class fields syntax, you can use an arrow function in the callback:

```Javascript
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the LoggingButton renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.

### 4. Routing

Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native.

### 5. Unit Testing with Jest & Enzyme

As your codebase expands, small errors and edge cases you don’t expect can cascade into larger failures. Bugs lead to bad user experience and ultimately, business losses. One way to prevent fragile programming is to test your code before releasing it into the wild.

In this guide, we will cover different, automated ways to ensure your app works as expected, ranging from static analysis to end-to-end tests.

We're humans, and humans make mistakes. Testing is important because it helps you uncover these mistakes and verifies that your code is working. Perhaps even more importantly, testing ensures that your code continues to work in the future as you add new features, refactor the existing ones, or upgrade major dependencies of your project.

There is more value in testing than you might realize. One of the best ways to fix a bug in your code is to write a failing test that exposes it. Then when you fix the bug and re-run the test, if it passes it means the bug is fixed, never reintroduced into the code base.

Tests can also serve as **documentation** for new people joining your team. For people who have never seen a codebase before, reading tests can help them understand how the existing code works.

Last but not least, more automated testing means less time spent with manual QA, freeing up valuable time.

#### **Static Analysis**

The first step to improve your code quality is to start using static analysis tools. Static analysis checks your code for errors as you write it, but without running any of that code.

Linters analyze code to catch common errors such as unused code and to help avoid pitfalls, to flag style guide no-nos like using tabs instead of spaces (or vice versa, depending on your configuration).

Type checking ensures that the construct you’re passing to a function matches what the function was designed to accept, preventing passing a string to a counting function that expects a number, for instance.

#### **Writing Testable Code**

To start with tests, you first need to write code that is testable. Consider an aircraft manufacturing process - before any model first takes off to show that all of its complex systems work well together, individual parts are tested to guarantee they are safe and function correctly. For example, wings are tested by bending them under extreme load; engine parts are tested for their durability; the windshield is tested against simulated bird impact.

Software is similar. Instead of writing your entire program in one huge file with many lines of code, you write your code in multiple small modules that you can test more thoroughly than if you tested the assembled whole. In this way, writing testable code is intertwined with writing clean, modular code.

To make your app more testable, start by separating the view part of your app—your React components—from your business logic and app state (regardless of whether you use Redux, MobX or other solutions). This way, you can keep your business logic testing—which shouldn’t rely on your React components—independent of the components themselves, whose job is primarily rendering your app’s UI!

Theoretically, you could go so far as to move all logic and data fetching out of your components. This way your components would be solely dedicated to rendering. Your state would be entirely independent of your components. Your app’s logic would work without any React components at all!

You can test React components similar to testing other JavaScript code.

There are a few ways to [test React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html). Broadly, they divide into two categories:

- Rendering component trees in a simplified test environment and asserting on their output.

- Running a complete app in a realistic browser environment (also known as “end-to-end” tests).

### **Structuring Tests**

Your tests should be short and ideally test only one thing. Let's start with an example unit test written with Jest:

```javascript
it('given a date in the past, colorForDueDate() returns red', () => {
  expect(colorForDueDate('2000-10-20')).toBe('red');
});
```

The test is described by the string passed to the it function. Take good care writing the description so that it’s clear what is being tested. Do your best to cover the following:

Given - some precondition
When - some action executed by the function that you’re testing
Then - the expected outcome
This is also known as AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert).

Jest offers describe function to help structure your tests. Use describe to group together all tests that belong to one functionality. Describes can be nested, if you need that. Other functions you'll commonly use are beforeEach or beforeAll that you can use for setting up the objects you're testing. Read more in the Jest api reference.

If your test has many steps or many expectations, you probably want to split it into multiple smaller ones. Also, ensure that your tests are completely independent of one another. Each test in your suite must be executable on its own without first running some other test. Conversely, if you run all your tests together, the first test must not influence the output of the second one.

Lastly, as developers we like when our code works great and doesn't crash. With tests, this is often the opposite. Think of a failed test as of a good thing! When a test fails, it often means something is not right. This gives you an opportunity to fix the problem before it impacts the users.

#### **Unit tests**

Unit tests cover the smallest parts of code, like individual functions or classes.

When the object being tested has any dependencies, you’ll often need to mock them out, as described in the next paragraph.

The great thing about unit tests is that they are quick to write and run. Therefore, as you work, you get fast feedback about whether your tests are passing. Jest even has an option to continuously run tests that are related to code you’re editing: Watch mode.
